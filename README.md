# Titanic-EDA-ML-kaggle
In this challenge, I will analyze and use ML algorithms to predict which passengers will survive the crash, using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

In Jupyter Homenotebook titanic.ipynb contains a file of the implementation of ML algorithms and data research.
